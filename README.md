# Simple Calculator

This is my first solo project || a basic calculator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  

I created it as part of my learning journey !!

---

## 🚀 Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `÷`
- Clear (`AC`) and Delete (`DEL`) buttons
- Responsive and minimal layout
- Built using only vanilla JavaScript

---

## 📁 Files

- `index.html` — the structure of the calculator
- `style.css` — styling and layout
- `script.js` — all the logic for button clicks and calculation

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Handling click events
- Updating values dynamically
- Using `eval()` (safely) to evaluate math expressions
- Git and GitHub basics

## 🌐 Live Demo

Coming soon on GitHub Pages!
